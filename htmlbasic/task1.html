    <h3>A few facts about the world we live in</h3>

    <img src="fun-facts-about-earth.webp" width="150" height="150" />

    <p>While Earth is only the fifth largest planet in the solar system, it is the only world in our solar system with
        liquid water on the surface. Just slightly larger than nearby Venus, Earth is the biggest of the four planets
        closest to the Sun, all of which are made of rock and metal.

        Earth is the only planet in the solar system whose English name does not come from Greek or Roman mythology. The
        name was taken from Old English and Germanic. It simply means "the ground." There are, of course, many names for
        our planet in the thousands of languages spoken by the people of the third planet from the Sun.
